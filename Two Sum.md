**The Problem: **

You have a list of numbers (let's call it nums), and you're given another number (let's call it target). Your task is to find two numbers in the list nums that, when added together, equal the target. You need to return the positions (indices) of these two numbers in the list.

**Here's an example: **

Suppose you have the list nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], and the target is 9. You need to find two numbers in this list that add up to 9. In this case, 2 and 7 are the numbers you're looking for, and their positions in the list are 0 and 1. So, the answer is [0, 1].

**The Solution: **

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a strategy with a dictionary (kind of like a phone book) to keep track of the numbers we've seen so far. Here's how it works, step by step:

We create a dictionary (let's call it num_indices) to store the numbers we've seen along with their positions (indices).

We go through the list numbers one number at a time, and we also keep track of the current position using a counter.

For each number in nums, we calculate another number called the "complement." The complement is what we need to add to the current number to reach the target. For example, if the target is 9 and the current number is 2, the complement is 9 - 2 = 7.

We check if this complement number exists in our num_indices dictionary. If it does, that means we've already seen a number earlier that can be added to the current number to reach the target. So, we found our answer, and we returned the positions (indices) of these two numbers.

If we don't find the complement in the dictionary, we add the current number and its position to the dictionary. This way, we remember that we've seen this number in case it's needed later.

We continue this process for all the numbers in the list. If we reach the end of the list without finding a solution, it means there are no two numbers that add up to the target, and we return an empty list or handle the situation as needed.

The cool thing about this approach is that it's efficient because it only goes through the list once. It's like you're scanning the list with a memory of the numbers you've seen, making it much faster than trying all possible pairs of numbers, which would take a lot more time (an O(n^2) approach). Instead, this solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list.

So, in simple terms, we're using a clever trick with a dictionary to find two numbers in a list that add up to a specific target number without having to check every possible pair.
